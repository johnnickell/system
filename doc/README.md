# Novuso System

Novuso System is a PHP library containing various low-level tools.

Many of these are implementations of common tools that are already provided
with other programming languages, but were lacking in PHP at the time of
writing. Examples include
[enumerated types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) and
[abstract data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures).

In addition, alternatives to existing native PHP solutions were created as they
seemed useful. For example, a hierarchy of custom
[exception](http://php.net/manual/en/spl.exceptions.php) classes and an alternative
[serialization](http://php.net/manual/en/class.serializable.php) solution is provided.

This project has no external dependencies beyond PHP version 7.1 or greater.
This project follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
